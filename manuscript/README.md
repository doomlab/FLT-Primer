# Manuscript

To recreate this manuscript exactly, you will need *R*, RStudio, and several packages.

- Download the entire GitHub folder
- Save/unzip the folder to your computer
- Be sure all packages are installed - with the newest version of RStudio, you can simply open the file, and it will suggest packages to install. 
- We have also included a packrat version of the packages, for reproducibility if anything changes over time.
- You should then be able to run the manuscript.
